## Kritter Killer {a 2D Pygame}  
Kritter Killer is a 2D shooting game written in python3.  
It imports pygame as well as sys, time and json. The json file is to maintain a persistent high score for the game.  
There are 10 python scripts total, so the game class imports 9 modules built to create it.  
The game class is called kritter_killer.py   
The shooter shoots left to right at various insects, scorpions, snakes, etc. marching towards him.  
It has local resources obtained online or adapted, that do not require any attribution.  
There are 8 sound or music files and 10 small image files, though how many kritters come attacking at once depends on the users display settings.  
I had adapted this from a previous game I had built from a book -- _Python Crash Course_.  
That was a lot like Space Invaders. This game has a number of modifications and add-ons I thought of and developed into the game.  
These include music, sound effects, muzzle blasts, the ability to pause the action, a legend for instructions, etc.  
Although the images are pretty basic, so it's not the most visually appealing.  
I didn't have the time/money to find/build/buy amazing images, I spent my time building the functionality.
